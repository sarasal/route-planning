    <b-row ref="trafficHigh" v-if="highChanceTraffic">* There is a very high chance  with orange or red color indicating heavy or moderate traffic. Traffic jams results in extended travel times when taking the bus or taxi, causing a decrease in the average speed of buses by 5 to 10 km per hour and taxis by 10 to 20 km per hour. </b-row>
    <b-row ref="trafficLow" v-if="lowChanceTraffic">* There is a very low chance that streets will become congested, indicated by the orange and red colors on the map representing moderate and heavy traffic jams. Traffic jams results in extended travel times when taking the bus or taxi, causing a decrease in the average speed of buses by 5 to 10 km per hour and taxis by 10 to 20 km per hour. </b-row>
    <b-row ref="trafficFixed" v-if="highMediumDiagnose">* Traffic jam is demonstrated on the map, with orange or red color indicating heavy or moderate traffic. Traffic jams results in extended travel times when taking the bus or taxi, causing a decrease in the average speed of buses by 5 to 10 km per hour and taxis by 10 to 20 km per hour. </b-row>

    <b-row ref="capacityHigh" v-if="highChanceCapacity">* There is a high possibility of not catching the intended bus or train due to limited or no seats condition, resulting in an additional travel time of 10 (for buses) to 20 minutes (for trains).</b-row>
    <b-row ref="capacityLow" v-if="lowChanceCapacity">* There is a high possibility of catching the intended bus or train, due to seat availability of buses and trains.</b-row>
    <b-row ref="capacityFixed" v-if="highMediumDiagnose">* In situations where no or limited seats are available, there is a possibility of not catching the intended bus or train, resulting in an additional travel time of 10 (for buses) to 20 minutes (for trains).</b-row>


    <b-row ref="peakFares" v-if="high">* Peak hours fall within these ranges: 6:30 - 9 AM, 4 - 6:30 PM, and 8 - 10:30 PM.</b-row>
    <b-row ref="distantBasedFare" v-if="high">* If the commuter travels at least 10 km by train or 4 km by bus, a discount based on the kilometers traveled will be applied to her fare.</b-row>
    <b-row ref="limitedTransfers" v-if="high">* The number of transfers between transport modes is limited to {{n_transfer}}.</b-row>

    <b-row ref="stopHigh" v-if="highChanceStop">* It is highly probable that the commuter might have to stop for something on her route, which could lead her to cross at the indicated point on the map.</b-row>
    <b-row ref="stopLow" v-if="lowChanceStop">* It is lowly probable that the commuter might have to stop for something on her route, which could lead her to cross at the indicated point on the map.</b-row>
